## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher installed on your system.
- (Optional) Bash shell for running the build script on Linux/macOS.

### Building and Running (Linux/macOS)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BiTech5/Nebula-Breaker
   cd Nebula-Breaker
   ```

2. **Build and run using the provided Bash script:**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```
   This script will:
   - Create a `bin` directory if it doesn't exist.
   - Compile all Java source files from `src/` into `bin/`.
   - Run the game.

### Building and Running (Windows)

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.**
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```cmd
   cd path\to\Nebula-Breaker
   ```
3. **Compile the Java files:**
   ```cmd
   mkdir bin
   javac -d bin src\main\Main.java src\core\*.java src\util\*.java src\view\*.java
   ```
   Or, to compile all Java files recursively:
   ```cmd
   javac -d bin $(dir /s /b src\*.java)
   ```
   *(If using Git Bash or WSL, you can use the provided `build.sh` script.)*

4. **Run the game:**
   ```cmd
   cd bin
   java src.main.Main
   ```

### Running on macOS
